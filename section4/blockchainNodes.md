# remix ide and blockchain nodes

there are three main options for remix to choose from:
1. javaScript VM - remix VM node (easiest)
2. injected web3 - connects to metamask and uses associated network
3. web3 provider - connects to localhost (ganache, hardhat)

# networks

ethereum protocol can be used in private networks, separate from the mainnet

mainnet - main network

ropsten, rinkeby, gorli - test networks (based off current or older versions of mainnet protocols), data is persistent but can be deleted.

ganache, hardhat - developer networks (based off current mainnet protocols), data is non-persistent


# developer workflow

1. developer network development
2. test network deployment and testing
3. mainnet (no return, it costs real money and is immutable)
